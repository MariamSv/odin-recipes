                    <ol>
                        <li>If your nuts are not roasted, put them in a pan and roast them for about two to three minutes.</li>
                        <li>Pour the grape juice into a pot and put it on medium heat until it reaches the boiling point and its volume is reduced by half.
                        <br>
                            <strong>Note:</strong> keep 200 ml of grape juice aside.    
                        </li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the flour with the 200 ml of grape juice that you set aside before. Using a whisk, mix them well until the flour is completely dissolved in the grape juice. </li>
                        <li>Using a thread and a needle, string walnuts, hazelnuts or any other nuts of your choice (until it reaches 25 cm in length.) </li>
                        <li>At the same time, when the grape juice is boiling on the flame, add the flour and grape juice mixture and stir it continuously.</li>
                        <li>After about five to ten minutes, stir it with a wooden spoon on medium heat until it gets enough concentration.</li>
                        <li>Dip the nuts you have threaded into the pot, so they are entirely covered with juice (this special ingredient is called <b>Tatara</b> in Georgia).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Hang the Churchkhela for about seven to ten days to dry completely. If you keep it in a cool place, you can use it for up to one year.   
                    </p>
